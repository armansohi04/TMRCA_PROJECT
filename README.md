# 🧬 TMRCA Simulation

This project simulates the number of generations it takes for a population to reach a Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) using random sampling methods based on Chang’s model.

## 📂 Included Files
- `tmrca_simulation.R` – Core simulation script  
- `tmrca_results.csv` – Output data from 25 simulations per population size  
- `tmrca_boxplot.png` – Visualization of results  

## 📖 Description
The script models how long it takes, in generations, for a population of size **1000**, **2000**, and **4000** to converge to a single common ancestor through random reproduction.  
Results are summarized and visualized for clarity.

This project was developed as part of my academic exploration in population modeling using **R**.

## ⚙️ How to Run

Open **R** and run:
```R
source("tmrca_simulation.R")

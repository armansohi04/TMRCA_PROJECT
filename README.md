# TMRCA Simulation

This project simulates the number of generations it takes for a population to reach a Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) using random sampling methods based on Chang’s model.

## Included Files

- `tmrca_simulation.R`: Core simulation script
- `tmrca_results.csv`: Output data from 25 simulations per population size
- `tmrca_boxplot.png`: Visualization of results

## Description

The script models how long it takes, in generations, for a population of size 1000, 2000, and 4000 to converge to a single common ancestor through random reproduction. Results are summarized and visualized for clarity.

This project was developed as part of my academic exploration in population modeling using R.
